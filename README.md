# server-public
server code for online game

## Setup

Download the code as a zip, and unzip it. Then change your working directory to this folder:
```
cd path/to/where/you/downloaded/this/folder
```

## Run the server

```
python3 server.py

```

### Use `python` instead of `python3` on windows.

You can then run the client code, and enter this server's **local IP** for the IP address, and port **5555**, to connect to the server.
