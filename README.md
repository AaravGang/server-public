# Server Code for online tic tac toe and connect4

---

## Install dependencies

```
pip3 install pygame
```

**Use `pip` on windows**

## Run the server

```
cd path/to/where/u/downloaded/this/folder
python3 server.py
```

‚òùüèªAbove commands will switch yo working directory to where u download this folder, and then run the server.

**On windows use `python` instead of `python3`**

The server is up and running, clients can connect to it!

## But first run the wonderful bot!

**Open a new terminal/cmd window and paste the following commands to run the bot**

```
cd path/to/where/u/downloaded/this/folder
cd Bot/
python3 bot.py
```

## Now you can run the client code ( find that in another repo ), and play against other users!
